# Short Strangle Strategy with VIX-Based Delta Adjustment

## Setup:

### VIX-Based Delta Selection:
- **30-45DTE**
- **When VIX > 20:**
  - Sell a Call with a delta of approximately **0.16**.
  - Sell a Put with a delta of approximately **0.16**.
  - Margin 30%

- **When VIX â‰¤ 20 & > 15:**
- **30-45DTE**
  - Sell a Call with a delta of approximately **0.12**.
  - Sell a Put with a delta of approximately **0.12**.
  - Margin 50%

## Position Management:

### Profit Target:
- Close the entire strangle when a **40% - 50% profit** is achieved on the position when VIX is > 20
- Close the entire strangle when a **25% - 40% profit** is achieved on the position when VIX is < 20

### 21 DTE Management:
- **If the position is in profit** at 21 days to expiration (DTE), close the trade.
- **If the position is not in profit** at 21 DTE, roll the entire position out to the next expiration cycle
- **Margin 60%
  - Adjust both the call and the put to have a **0.20 delta** in the new expiration cycle, regardless of the VIX level. This adjustment aims to reset the trade with a balanced risk profile, 
    potentially allowing it to recover and achieve the profit target.

## Rolling Rules:

### Only Roll the Untested Side:
- If one side of the strangle (call or put) becomes "untested" (price moves away from this side, reducing delta), consider rolling that side to maintain the balance of the trade.

### Delta-Based Rolling:
- If the delta of the untested side falls below **0.08**, roll that option to:
  - **Option 1:** The original delta (0.12 or 0.16 depending on the VIX level).
  - **Option 2:** A higher delta (above 0.12 or 0.16) to collect more premium if comfortable with the additional risk.

### Maximum Adjustment with Profit Close:
- If rolling the untested side would bring the strikes to the point where the position becomes a **straddle** (i.e., the call and put strikes are the same), and the overall position is in profit, 
  **close the position** rather than rolling. This prevents taking on excessive risk by avoiding an inversion while locking in profits.
