# The Wheel Strategy Rules

## Step 2: Sell Puts
Start the Wheel by selling short (naked) Puts or Cash Secured Puts (CSPs). Ensure your account has sufficient cash or margin to purchase the shares if assigned.

- **Process:**
  - **Entry:** Sell Puts at 30-45 DTE for optimal premium, targeting a 50% probability of being out-of-the-money (â‰ˆ 0.30 Delta).
  - **Risk Management:** Limit risk to 5% of the account per trade, keeping approximately 50% of the account in cash to manage downturns, assignments, and opportunities.
  - **Profit-Taking:** Set a GTC (Good 'Til Canceled) Limit Order to close the Put at 50% profit. Continue selling Puts based on your criteria.
  - **Rolling:** If the Put is challenged, roll out in time and down in strike for a net credit whenever possible. If a net credit is not achievable, allow the Put to expire and take assignment.

## Step 3: Sell Covered Calls

### Process:
- **Entry:** Sell a Call with 7-10 DTE at or above the net stock cost around .30 delta
- **Wait for Opportunity:** If you can't sell a Call at or above the net stock cost, wait until the share price rises.
- **Exit:** Continue selling Covered Calls until the position is recovered

## Step 4: Review and Repeat
After completing Step 3, review your strategy and return to Step 1.
