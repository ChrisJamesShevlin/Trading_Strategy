# SPX Put Ratio Spread Trading Plan

## 1. High Volatility Environment (VIX > 20)
- **Long Put:** Buy a put with a delta of -0.40.
- **Short Puts:** Sell two puts with a delta of -0.16 each.
- **Rationale:** Lower delta on short puts reduces risk in volatile markets while still collecting premium.

## 2. Low Volatility Environment (VIX ≤ 20)
- **Long Put:** Buy a put with a delta of -0.40.
- **Short Puts:** Sell two puts with a delta of -0.20 each.
- **Rationale:** Higher delta short puts capture more premium in less volatile markets.

## Trade Management

### Before 21 DTE:
- **Profit-Taking:** Close the position when 35% of max profit is achieved.

### At 21 DTE:
- **In Profit:** Close the entire position to lock in gains.
- **In Loss:**
  - **Close the Position:** Exit the trade by closing both the long put and one of the short puts.
  - **Roll Remaining Short Put:**
    - Roll the remaining short put out in time and down to a lower strike.
    - Adjust the delta and/or contract size to ensure that if the market rallies, the position will be profitable overall.
  - **If Market Continues to Drop:**
    - If the market drops below the adjusted short put strike, purchase SPX (or equivalent ETF) for an equal or greater contract size.
    - Hold the position until the market recovers to manage the drawdown.

### At Expiry (If Market Doesn’t Recover):
- **ETF Purchase:**
  - **If Short Put ITM:** Buy the equivalent ETF (e.g., SPY) matching or exceeding the contract size of the short put.
  - **Handling Drawdown:**
    - **Wait for Market Recovery:** Hold the ETF, accepting drawdown until recovery.
    - **Add to Position:** If the market continues to decline but recovery is likely, consider adding to the position to lower the average cost basis and potentially shorten the drawdown period.
