- **Process:**
  - **Entry:** Sell Puts at >30 DTE for optimal premium, targeting a 50% probability of being out-of-the-money (â‰ˆ 0.30 Delta).
  - **Risk Management:** Limit risk to 5% of the account per trade, keeping approximately 50% of the account in cash to manage downturns, assignments, and opportunities.
  - **Profit-Taking:** Set a GTC (Good 'Til Canceled) Limit Order to close the Put at 50% profit.
  - **Rolling Management:**
    - **Roll Down if Tested and Time Allows:** If the put is tested (stock price approaches or drops to the strike price) and the option has more than 21 days until expiration (DTE), 
    roll down to a lower strike price while maintaining the same expiration, provided this roll generates a net credit.
    - **Roll Out and Adjust to Short Straddle Near Expiration:** If the put is tested and there are 21 DTE or fewer, roll the position out in time by one to two weeks. Simultaneously, 
    sell a call at the same strike as the put, converting the position into a short straddle. This ensures that the premium collected will be enough to cover any potential losses.
    - **Consider Inverted Roll if Price Continues to Fall:** If the stock price continues to fall after establishing the short straddle, consider rolling to an inverted position 
    (where the call strike is below the put strike) to maintain a net credit and manage risk. This inversion strategy is aimed at collecting enough premium to reduce or eliminate losses.


## Step 2: Review and Repeat
After the put expires or is assigned, review your strategy and return to Step 1.
