# SPX Put Ratio Spread Trading Plan

## 1. High Volatility Environment (VIX > 20)
- **Long Put:** Buy a put with a delta of -0.40.
- **Short Puts:** Sell two puts with a delta of -0.16 each.
- **Rationale:** Lower delta on short puts reduces risk in volatile markets while still collecting premium.

## 2. Low Volatility Environment (VIX â‰¤ 20)
- **Long Put:** Buy a put with a delta of -0.40.
- **Short Puts:** Sell two puts with a delta of -0.20 each.
- **Rationale:** Higher delta short puts capture more premium in less volatile markets.

## Trade Management

### If Price Drops Below the Short Puts:
- **Close and Roll:**
  - Immediately close the entire position if the price drops below the strikes of the two short puts.
  - Roll one short put out in time and down to a lower strike, maintaining equal or greater delta.
  - This ensures the new position remains profitable if the market rebounds.
- **If Price Drops Below the Rolled Put:**
  - Close the rolled short put.
  - Purchase SPX (or an equivalent ETF) for an equal or greater contract size.
  - Hold this position until the market recovers.

### At 21 DTE:
- **If in Profit:** Close the entire position to lock in gains.
- **If in Loss and Price Between Strikes:**
  - Close the long put and one of the short puts, leaving one short put open until 7 DTE.
- **At 7 DTE:**
  - **If Market Rallies and Position Becomes Profitable:** Close the remaining short put to secure profits.
  - **If Market Drops Below the Short Put or Remains Unprofitable:**
    - Roll the short put out in time and down to a lower strike, following the same rules as above:
      - Adjust for equal or greater delta to ensure a profitable position if the market rebounds.
