# Combined Trading Strategy: 111 Plan & Short Strangle with VIX-Based Delta Adjustment

## Overview:

This strategy combines two trading approaches based on VIX levels:
1. **111 Trading Plan**: A put debit spread strategy with additional short puts, activated when VIX is below 15 and falling.
2. **Short Strangle Strategy**: A strangle option strategy adjusted based on VIX levels, applied when the VIX is above 15.

## 1. 111 Trading Plan (VIX < 15 and Falling)

### Market Condition:
- **VIX Condition:** Apply this strategy when the VIX is less than 15 and trending downwards.

### Strategy:
- **Entry Criteria:**
  - Initiate the trade only when the VIX is below 15 and showing signs of further decline.

- **Position Details:**
  - **Days to Expiration (DTE):** 45 DTE on /ES (E-mini S&P 500 Futures Options).
  - **Put Debit Spread:**
    - Buy a 30 delta long put.
    - Sell a 28 delta short put.
  - **Short Puts:**
    - Sell a 10 delta short put.

- **Profit Target:**
  - **Take Profit:** Close the .10 delta short put when you achieve a 90% and leave debit spread to expiry

- **Risk Management:**
  - **Stop Loss:** Not applicable unless the price closes below BB
  - **Switch to Srangles**
   

### Additional Considerations:
- **Trend Confirmation:** Ensure the market is trending or stable when VIX is falling. Avoid initiating this strategy in a highly volatile market, even if VIX is low.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the VIX. If VIX begins to rise, reconsider the position or adjust accordingly.

## 2. Short Strangle Strategy with VIX-Based Delta Adjustment

### Setup:

#### VIX-Based Delta Selection:
- **30-45 DTE**
  - **When VIX > 20 and elevated SD:**
    - Sell a Call with a delta of approximately **0.16**.
    - Sell a Put with a delta of approximately **0.16**.
    - Margin 30%
  
  - **When VIX â‰¤ 20 & > 15 and elevated SD:**
    - Sell a Call with a delta of approximately **0.12**.
    - Sell a Put with a delta of approximately **0.12**.
    - Margin 50%

### Position Management:

#### Profit Target:
- **VIX > 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **40% - 50% profit** is achieved on the position.
- **VIX < 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **25% - 40% profit** is achieved on the position.

#### 21 DTE Management:
- **If the position is in profit** at 21 days to expiration (DTE), close the trade.
- **If the position is not in profit** at 21 DTE, roll the entire position out to the next expiration cycle.
  - **Margin 60%**: Adjust both the call and the put to have a **0.20 delta** in the new expiration cycle, regardless of the VIX level. This adjustment aims to reset the trade 
      with a balanced risk profile, potentially allowing it to recover and achieve the profit target.

### Rolling Rules:

#### Only Roll the Untested Side:
- If one side of the strangle (call or put) becomes "untested" (price moves away from this side, reducing delta), consider rolling that side to maintain the balance of the trade.

#### Delta-Based Rolling:
- If the delta of the untested side falls below **0.08**, roll that option to:
  - **Option 1:** The original delta (0.12 or 0.16 depending on the VIX level).
  - **Option 2:** A higher delta (above 0.12 or 0.16) to collect more premium if comfortable with the additional risk.

#### Maximum Adjustment with Profit Close:
- If rolling the untested side would bring the strikes to the point where the position becomes a **straddle** (i.e., the call and put strikes are the same), and the overall position is in profit, 
  - **close the position** rather than rolling. This prevents taking on excessive risk by avoiding an inversion while locking in profits.
