# Iron Condor Trading Strategy

This strategy utilizes iron condors in both high and low volatility environments, with specific adjustments for managing risk and optimizing profits. The strategy is divided into two parts: one for high volatility and one for low volatility.

## High Volatility Environment

### Criteria:
- **Market Condition:** High volatility (VIX > 20).
- **Days to Expiration (DTE):** 45 days.
- **Wings:** $10 wide (difference between short and long strikes).
- **Delta for Short Options:** 0.10 for both call and put sides.

### Execution:
1. **Entry:**
   - Sell a call and put with a delta of 0.10.
   - Buy a call and put $10 away from the short strikes to form the iron condor.

2. **Profit Target:**
   - Close the position when you achieve 40% of the maximum profit.

3. **Rolling the Untested Side:**
   - If one side is tested and the position has more than 21 DTE, roll the untested side to the same delta (0.10) at the time of the new opening.

4. **21 DTE Decision:**
   - **If the position is showing a profit:** Close the entire position regardless of whether it has reached the 40% profit target.
   - **If the position is at a loss:** Roll the entire iron condor out in time to a new expiration (preferably 45 DTE) and adjust the deltas:
     - Increase the delta of the new short strikes to 0.20 to collect more premium and recover from the loss.
