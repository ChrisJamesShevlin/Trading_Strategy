# Put Ratio Spread Trading Strategy

## Trade Setup
- **Long Put:** Buy a put with a delta of -0.40.
- **Short Puts:** Sell two puts with deltas around -0.25 each, ensuring you collect an overall profit at expiry.
- **Duration:** Initiate the trade with approximately 30-45 days to expiration (DTE).

## Take Profit
- **Target Profit:** Close the entire position when you achieve 30-35% of the maximum profit.

## Trade Management

### If Short Puts are Tested
1. **Close and Roll:**
   - **Close:** Close the long put and one of the short puts.
   - **Roll:** Roll the remaining short put down (if above 21 DTE). Ensure this rolled put will still achieve a profit for the entire trade overall if the market rebounds.

### If Less than 21 DTE and the Trade is Still in Loss
1. **Roll Strategy:**
   - **Roll the Short Put:** Roll the remaining short put out in time and down to a lower strike.
   - **Profit Check:** Ensure the new rolled put will still achieve a profit for the entire trade overall.
   - **Repeat:** Continue rolling the short put as necessary until you can no longer roll for sufficient profit without increasing contract size.

### If You Can No Longer Roll for Sufficient Profit
1. **Purchase the Underlying:**
   - **Buy Underlying:** Purchase the underlying asset (SPX or equivalent ETF) for an equal or greater contract size.
   - **Sell Call:** Sell a call option with a delta of around +0.30, ideally with a shorter-term expiration (10-14 DTE). If necessary, choose a longer DTE.

## Key Points
- **Profit Target:** Take profits early when 30-35% of max profit is achieved.
- **Rolling Considerations:** Roll the position to adjust strikes and manage risk while maintaining overall profitability.
- **Underlying Purchase:** Transition to purchasing the underlying and selling calls if rolling is no longer viable without increasing contract size.
