### VIX-Based Delta Selection Strategies

#### **1. High Volatility Environment (VIX > 20)**
   - **30-45 DTE:**
     - **Strategy:**
       - **Sell a Call** with a delta of approximately **0.18**.
       - **Sell a Put** with a delta of approximately **0.18**.
       - **Margin**: **50%**
     - **Rationale:** With the VIX above 20, higher volatility is expected, so a slightly more aggressive delta is chosen to capture greater premium within the 30-45 DTE window, 
         which balances time decay and risk.

#### **2. Moderate Volatility Environment (VIX Between 15 and 20)**
   - **30-45 DTE:**
     - **Strategy:**
       - **Sell a Call** with a delta of approximately **0.14**.
       - **Sell a Put** with a delta of approximately **0.14**.
       - **Margin**: **40%**
     - **Rationale:** In a moderately volatile environment, a balanced delta approach within the 30-45 DTE range is optimal. This allows for sufficient premium collection while managing potential 
         volatility-induced risks.

#### **3. Low Volatility Environment (VIX < 15)**

# OTM Call Calendar Spread Strategy
## 1. Set Up the Position
- **Strike Price:** Select an OTM strike price with a delta of approximately 0.30.
- **Short Call:** Sell 1 call option with 30-45 days to expiration (DTE) at the chosen strike price.
- **Long Call:** Buy 1 call option with 60-90 days to expiration (DTE) at the same strike price.
- **Margin**: **30%**

## 2. Set Profit Target
- **Target Profit:** Aim to close the position when the value of the spread reaches 25% above the initial net debit.

## 3. Risk Management
- **Do Not Roll:** Do not roll the position or partially close it. Exit the entire position based on the profit target or leave to expire with defined risk


### Summary
- **VIX > 20 (30-45 DTE):** Aggressive delta (0.18) to capitalize on high premiums due to increased volatility.
- **VIX 15-20 (30-45 DTE):** Balanced delta (0.14) to match moderate volatility expectations.
- **VIX < 15 (>60 DTE):** Conservative delta (0.10) with longer expiration to leverage time decay in a low-volatility environment.

### Position Management

#### Profit Target
- **VIX > 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **40% - 60% profit** is achieved on the position.
- **VIX < 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **20% - 30% profit** is achieved on the position.

#### 21 DTE Management
- **If the position is in profit** at 21 days to expiration (DTE), close the trade.
- **If the position is not in profit** at 21 DTE, roll the entire position out to the next expiration cycle.
- **Margin 60% if Vix > 15 / Margin 40% if Vix < 15**: Roll untested side to .20 delta with tested side at same delta level as per Vix level strategy. 

### Rolling Rules

#### Only Roll the Untested Side
- If one side of the strangle (call or put) becomes "untested" (price moves away from this side, reducing delta), consider rolling that side to maintain the balance of the trade.

#### Delta-Based Rolling
- If the delta of the untested side falls below **0.08**, roll that option to:
  - **Option 1:** The original delta (0.10/ 0.14/ 0.18 depending on the VIX level).
  - **Option 2:** A higher delta (above 0.12 or 0.16) to collect more premium if comfortable with the additional risk.

#### Maximum Adjustment with Profit Close
- If rolling the untested side would bring the strikes to the point where the position becomes a **straddle** (i.e., the call and put strikes are the same), and the overall position is in profit, 
  - **close the position** rather than rolling. This prevents taking on excessive risk by avoiding an inversion while locking in profits. 
  - **If the position is still in a loss roll out following the 21 DTE Management section.
