### VIX-Based Delta Selection Strategies

#### **1. High Volatility Environment (VIX > 20)**
   - **30-45 DTE:**
     - **Strategy:**
       - **Sell a Call** with a delta of approximately **0.18**.
       - **Sell a Put** with a delta of approximately **0.18**.
       - **Margin**: **50%**
     - **Rationale:** With the VIX above 20, higher volatility is expected, so a slightly more aggressive delta is chosen to capture greater premium within the 30-45 DTE window, 
         which balances time decay and risk.

#### **2. Moderate Volatility Environment (VIX Between 15 and 20)**
   - **30-45 DTE:**
     - **Strategy:**
       - **Sell a Call** with a delta of approximately **0.14**.
       - **Sell a Put** with a delta of approximately **0.14**.
       - **Margin**: **40%**
     - **Rationale:** In a moderately volatile environment, a balanced delta approach within the 30-45 DTE range is optimal. This allows for sufficient premium collection while managing potential 
         volatility-induced risks.

#### **3. Low Volatility Environment (VIX < 15)**
   - **>60 DTE:**
     - **Strategy:**
       - **Sell a Call** with a delta of approximately **0.10**.
       - **Sell a Put** with a delta of approximately **0.10**.
       - **Margin**: **30%**
     - **Rationale:** In a low volatility environment, with the VIX below 15, a more conservative delta is appropriate. The extended DTE (>60 days) allows you to take advantage of time 
         decay while minimizing risk due to the stable market conditions.

### Summary
- **VIX > 20 (30-45 DTE):** Aggressive delta (0.18) to capitalize on high premiums due to increased volatility.
- **VIX 15-20 (30-45 DTE):** Balanced delta (0.14) to match moderate volatility expectations.
- **VIX < 15 (>60 DTE):** Conservative delta (0.10) with longer expiration to leverage time decay in a low-volatility environment.

### Position Management

#### Profit Target
- **VIX > 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **40% - 60% profit** is achieved on the position.
- **VIX < 20:** Close the entire strangle when a **20% - 30% profit** is achieved on the position.

#### 21 DTE Management
- **If the position is in profit** at 21 days to expiration (DTE), close the trade.
- **If the position is not in profit** at 21 DTE, roll the entire position out to the next expiration cycle.
- **Margin 60% if Vix > 15 / Margin 40% if Vix < 15**: Roll untested side to .20 delta with tested side at same delta level as per Vix level strategy. 

### Rolling Rules

#### Only Roll the Untested Side
- If one side of the strangle (call or put) becomes "untested" (price moves away from this side, reducing delta), consider rolling that side to maintain the balance of the trade.

#### Delta-Based Rolling
- If the delta of the untested side falls below **0.08**, roll that option to:
  - **Option 1:** The original delta (0.12 or 0.16 depending on the VIX level).
  - **Option 2:** A higher delta (above 0.12 or 0.16) to collect more premium if comfortable with the additional risk.

#### Maximum Adjustment with Profit Close
- If rolling the untested side would bring the strikes to the point where the position becomes a **straddle** (i.e., the call and put strikes are the same), and the overall position is in profit, 
  - **close the position** rather than rolling. This prevents taking on excessive risk by avoiding an inversion while locking in profits.
