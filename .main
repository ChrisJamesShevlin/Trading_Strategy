# The Wheel Strategy Rules

## Step 1: Sell Puts
Start the Wheel by selling short (naked) puts. Ensure your account has sufficient cash or margin to purchase the shares if assigned.

- **Process:**
  - **Entry:** Sell Puts at >30 DTE for optimal premium, targeting a 50% probability of being out-of-the-money (â‰ˆ 0.30 Delta).
  - **Risk Management:** Limit risk to 5% of the account per trade, keeping approximately 50% of the account in cash to manage downturns, assignments, and opportunities.
  - **Profit-Taking:** Set a GTC (Good 'Til Canceled) Limit Order to close the Put at 50% profit. 
  - **Rolling:**
    - If the Put is challenged (stock price approaches or drops to the strike price), roll out in time by one to two weeks while maintaining the same strike price. This helps to avoid 
      assignment while keeping the trade alive and profitable.
    - If a more advantageous strike can be rolled to while still collecting a net credit, consider rolling down to that strike.
    - **Rolling for Credit:** When the stock hits the strike price, the Put option becomes ATM, leading to a rich premium. Rolling at this point can often bring in a large net credit, 
      which helps reduce the net stock cost if assigned or increases overall credit to aid in achieving profit if the stock rebounds.
    - **Extended Rolling:** If the Put remains ITM, continue rolling out by one or two weeks each time so long as a net credit can be collected. This can be done over several months 
      until the stock recovers, allowing the trade to eventually close for a profit or, at worst, a small loss.
    - **Additional Short Put:** To "juice" returns, consider selling an additional short put to accelerate the position's recovery. Be prepared for the possibility of another stock assignment 
      and ensure you are comfortable with buying more shares if needed. Another assignment will further lower the net stock cost.

  - **Assignment:** If a net credit can no longer be achieved by rolling, allow the Put to expire and accept assignment. 

## Step 2: Sell Covered Calls

### Process:
- **Entry:** Sell a Call with 7-10 DTE at or above the old put level
- **Wait for Opportunity:** If you can't sell a Call at or above the old put level wait until the share price rises.
- **Exit:** Continue selling Covered Calls until the position is recovered.

## Step 3: Review and Repeat
After completing Step 3, review your strategy and return to Step 1
